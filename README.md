## Summary

For this exciting project we wanted to mainly solidify our understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by building out a game show. We decided to base it on Family Feud, but with a sci-fi spin on Cowboys and Aliens, which we were pretty excited about! This was an opportunity to work with classes to build a program at a larger scale than we had in our previous projects. This was also an opportunity for ourselves to build out a program based on user stories - which we knew is more aligned to what we can expect to see when working with product managers in a production environment.

## Play the game on GitHub Pages [here!](https://edwindelbosque.github.io/Cowboys-vs-Aliens/)

## Goals

- Write a program and UI/UX from scratch
- Synthesize knowledge of OOP, classes, and JS fundamentals to create a playable game
- Build this game by reading user stories on how this game plays out
- We also implemented multiple class inheritances throughout the project
- We wanted experience collaborating with multiple people and demostrate a good GitHub collaboration and workflow
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle) and SOLID principle.
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
- Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with game data
- Fetch an API for sending and receiving game data
- Style using CSS pre-processor SASS (SCSS)
- Use of spies for testing the DOM manipulation
- Get comfortable reviewing and writing feedback on each other's code in PR's

## Built with:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- SASS
- Mocha, Chai & Spies
